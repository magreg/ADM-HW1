# ADM-HW1

In the repository "ADM-HW1" there are three different files. Two are a python scripts, which are called Exercise_1 and Exercise_1, and a PDF file, called Final Point.

In the python script "Exercise_1", there are all the scripts regarding the first exercise of the homework 1. In particular, there are the scripts of the python challenges of the following topics: introduction, data types, strings, sets, collections, date and time, exceptions, built-ins, python functionals, regex and persing challenges, XML, closures and decoration, and numpy. In order to solve some challenges, I have consulted some post in the Hackerrank's discussion webpage.
