# ADM-HW1

In the repository "ADM-HW1" there are three different files. Two are a python scripts, which are called Exercise_1 and Exercise_1, and a PDF file, called Final Point.

In the python script "Exercise_1", there are all the scripts regarding the first exercise of the homework 1. In particular, there are the scripts of the python challenges of the following topics: introduction, data types, strings, sets, collections, date and time, exceptions, built-ins, python functionals, regex and persing challenges, XML, closures and decoration, and numpy. In order to solve some challenges, I have consulted some post in the Hackerrank's discussion webpage. More details on which exercises were needed to consult external material can be found inside the python script.   

In the python script "Exercise_2", there are all the scripts regarding the second exercise of the homework 1. In particular, there are the scripts of the following python problems: birthday cake candles, kangaroo, strange advertising, recursive digit sum, insertionsort 1 and insertionsort 2. In order to solve some challenges, I have consulted some post in the Hackerrank's discussion webpage. More details on which exercises were needed to consult external material can be found inside the python script. 

The last file is a PDF file, where the scores of the various Hackerrank challenges are reported. On the first page of the document, there is a summary table of the scores of the Exercise_1. In the rest of the pages, the scores of the individual exercises are reported.
